BookSky Website Overview:
BookSky is a simple and elegant web project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to act as a mini online library or book management system. 
The main idea behind this project is to allow users to easily add, view, and manage book details directly from the browser. 
It features a clean interface where users can enter information like the book title, author name, and category, and then display it instantly on the page. 
With the help of JavaScript DOM manipulation, new books appear dynamically without needing a page reload, making the website highly interactive and user-friendly.

The data added by users is stored using localStorage, so the books remain saved even after refreshing or closing the browser — no external database is required. 
The HTML handles the structure of the web page, CSS enhances the design with smooth styles, shadows, and layouts,
while JavaScript controls the logic for adding, deleting, and displaying books. The project also uses modern CSS features like Flexbox or Grid to keep the layout responsive across devices.

As a learning-based mini project, BookSky helps beginners understand front-end web development,
especially how to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create functional and dynamic web applications. 
It also introduces important topics like form handling, data persistence, and event-driven programming.
In future updates, the project can include features like editing books, search filters, and theme toggles. 
Overall, BookSky is a creative and practical project that blends simplicity, interactivity, and design — making it perfect for students’ portfolios or academic submissions.
